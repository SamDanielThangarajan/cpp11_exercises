nullptr:
	- keyword and a pointer literal(instance of type std::nullptr_t)
	- it is a prvalue (pure rvalue), So you cannot take the address of nullptr, (eg, &5, &10, &nullptr not allowed)
	- integeral null pointer constanst can be converted to nulptr_t but not the vice versa
	- int a = reinterpret_cast<int>(nullptr) has same value as (void*)0 to int type
	- can be initialized to bool (bool a = nullptr)
	- <cstddef>

Generic Selection: C11
	- Provides a way to choose one of several expressions at compile time, based on a type of a controlling expression
	- _Generic ( controlling-expression , association-list ) where association-list = type-name : expression

Static_assert:
	- assert.h
	- static_assert(bool_constexpr, message)

type_triats:
	- type_traits
	- the resulting values are available at compile time itself. So combining them with static_assert will be powerful
	- This header defines a series of classes to obtain type information on compile-time.
		The header contains:
		Helper classes: Standard classes to assist in creating compile-time constants.
		Type traits: Classes to obtain characteristics of types in the form of compile-time constant values.
		Type transformations: Classes to obtain new types by applying specific transformations to existing types.
	- You can also write type triats to have some functions which are not provided by the standard library
	- Refer: TypeTriats.cc
